<h1>The Best Movies According to Nitish</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Super 30</h3>
<p>
  Just like the protagonist, Nitish Kumar's journey mirrors the resilience
  depicted in Super 30. From Nalanda to NIT Mizoram, he conquered obstacles with
  unwavering determination. Now a Senior Software Engineer at Maxonic, Nitish's
  story embodies the power of perseverance, proving that with passion and
  resilience, dreams know no bounds.
